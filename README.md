## Install Choices
- `bower install ab-test`
- [download the zip](https://github.com/daniellmb/ab-test/archive/master.zip)

## Setup
1. Include the `ab-test.js` and `ab-test-service.js` scripts provided by this component into your app.
2. Add `ab.test` or `ab.test.directive` as a module dependency to your app.

## Usage

## `<ab-test>` Directive

### Properties
 - ab-frequency - REQUIRED: how often to show run the a/b test
 - ab-run - OPTIONAL: function to trigger running the test again
 - ab-shown - OPTIONAL: function to call when a variant is shown
 - ab-select (coming soon) - OPTIONAL: will be used to make sticky A/B tests

## `<ab-variant>` Directive
### Properties
 - ab-control - OPTIONAL: specify a variant as the A/B test "control"
 - ab-data - OPTIONAL: arbitrary data you may want to link to a variant, useful when logging.

## Sticky Tests

Running an A/B test is great but it's even better if you make the tests "sticky" to the user. Meaning if someone
at your site gets variant B the next time they load the page or come back they get variant B again and not A. You can
select a given variant by calling the `ab-select` method on the `<ab-test>` directive. How you track users is up to you,
but since A/B tests aren't permanent a simple solution will most likely do very well. One way would be to use a cookie with
[angular-uuid-service](https://github.com/daniellmb/angular-uuid-service) a light weight (214 byte) UUID generator service
for AngularJS that can be installed using `bower`. See the [demo](http://daniellmb.github.io/ab-test/demo/) for an example implementation.

### Running the demos

You can pick one of these options:

- serve this repository with your webserver
- use node.js and run `node scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/demo/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.

## Testing
- Run `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure you have all the development dependencies.
- Run `npm test` or `bash scripts/test.sh` to run all unit tests

### End to end testing
Requires a webserver;

- Run `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure you have all the development dependencies.
- Run `node ./scripts/web-server.js` or use your server that hosts the static files.
- Run the end-to-end tests from console with [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) via
    `bash scripts/e2e-test.sh`

## Contributing
Pull requests welcome :)
- Run `npm run gulp` to update the .min.js and min.js.map files with any changes you have made to ab-test.js.
